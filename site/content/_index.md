      Klaire's debut verse novel 'Ideas too big for our skin' tells the story of
      one girl's search for the truest version of herself. Artful and
      confronting, Klaire uses the familiarity of the everyday to expose deeper,
      universal truths.

      It's hypothesised that the Eskimo have over fifty different words for
      snow. Loyalty, it seems, can be experienced in just as many variations. 
      Luna and Van are just two of the characters who lead us into this heady
      exploration of the fluidity of loyalty and show us certainty has never
      been so uncertain.
