  I couldn't believe it. A friend stayed. Her whole family heard the warnings,
  saw the events unfold, and she and her family CHOSE to remain in an imminent
  bushfire zone. 


  Here's what they missed ...

Firstly, I must say, I don't get it. 

Not really. After all, I'm new to this stuff. 

Only four years deep into being a Victorian I've heard many stories over the course of this week from long-time residents of my town who were issued Emergency Warnings and chose to stay.

After my first evacuation, only a week ago, I became intrigued at the collective voices.

_"It wasn't like the fire of '03. We couldn't even see the flames."_ 

_"We've gone before and nothing actually happened."_

I found myself thinking, "Lucky all bushfires are predictable". 

It's not down to that though. Some will stay and some will leave and in each group, in any given event, some may be proven wrong. It's partly math, and partly just life.

And while being proven wrong when it comes to choosing to evacuate generally only has a catastrophic and lasting impact on one side of the decision matrix (much like taking your life savings to the casino and planning to win), it had me thinking about the other side of the experiential equation. 

Even more-so when I spent last night at Latchford Army Barracks.

On the fringe of an upgraded Watch & Act issued via Vic Emergency to show an imminent bushfire risk, I took the impending isolation of Bright as my trigger to leave. I was, uncharacteristically, home on my own and therefore without the planned husband and children, 4x4 vehicle, and camper trailer to evacuate with. So, I improvised and herded my 40 kilo border collie into the back of the Nissan Micra and prayed to a god I'm not sure I believe in. 

I reached the Relief Centre at Wangaratta and was greeted in a way that reduced me to tears. A crowd of people, who in a Centrelink line would have bitten your digits off just to jump the queue, were quiet and orderly and exuding a silent kind of gratitude for the care that was being shown to them.

And, holy shit. Next time you enter a crowded room of desperate people who care when they aren't being paid, drop me a line. We'll both shout them a beer. 

My newbie questions were answered with patience and then some, while water was ferried to my confused puppy tied up in the 43 degree heat outside. 

There was no accommodation left in town for one person with a furry 'plus one'. So I took the prompt to approach the army personnel there to check on lodging options. 

I cannot begin to convey how unique  the next several hours would be ...
