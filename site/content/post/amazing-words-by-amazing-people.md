Beautiful souls exist all over the world. And they're surprisingly easy to meet. 

But, it's not the meeting that is the special part.  It's what comes after. The 'getting to know'. The little moments of realisation. The 'snap' - moments of similarity you discover and the many, many more instances where you realise how different you are.

There in those differences lie the gold. 

In those differences, I find Ben. 

I can't quite recall now how Ben and I met (though he probably will!). I just feel like I've always known him. Ben lives in the heart of America .. now in his first little home and in a newly-found state of turmoil and disarray.

Ben has long been a writer (like me). It is a compulsion that drives him. He writes epic wartime novels and I write poems - in my mind these are literary opposites. 

Ben loves animals over people. He is disciplined in his craft. He has technical skills and a penchant for research.

In almost every way, Ben lives a life different to mine.

What I think many of us fail to recognise, is it's THAT - the differences - can be the biggest welcome mat someone puts out in this world. 

Why don't we seek more to embrace people who are different from us? People who are the same can comfort us a lot, but teach us very little. 

This is why I connect with Ben. We are an acknowledgement of the 'not so same'. A collaboration for mutual benefit. We are sounding boards. We are thinking routines. We are misunderstanding and discomfort. 

We are the striving for understanding. We are an exercise in empathy. And in patience.

There is much I learn from Ben each time we talk. 

We are someway along a journey and, at the end of the day, that may be towards divergent paths. Who knows?!

Think of a person who strikes a chord in you right now. Regardless of where you'll go or what you'll feel later on. 

Recognise the similarity. And, if you do nothing else, embrace the gift of all the pieces that are unlike you - that can teach you things about the world and about yourself.

You may well find a kinship with Ben (Yes, you can meet him here in this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5V0dxdI4e6Q). This resonates with me and I'm hoping it will stir a reaction in you.
