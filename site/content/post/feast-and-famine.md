  Sometimes it is endless contemplation that brews the most profound thoughts. 
  In this instance, it was simply hunger ...

An uncharacteristic craving for potato chips (salt and vinegar all the way, am I right?) had me considering a cheeky pre-lunch drive to the supermarket. After all, it would be a mere ten minutes before I was back home, albeit pushing down heavy doses of guilt, while I munched away.

In that moment It occurred to me how lucky I was that such a craving could so readily be sated. I mean the supermarket, which is open almost all of my waking hours each day, would never run out of my preferred flavour ... or at least a pretty reasonable alternative. And if that apocalyptic event should occur, there's always the local servo. 

I tried to imagine a circumstance where every shop in town, or across the region, found themselves devoid of bag and fried potato slices. An obscure thought then surfaced ... whole populations survived famines on potatoes alone. Is it possible that in my lifetime the world ever would - or could - run out of potato chips?

Hooray for consumerism, commercialism and the weights and balances of the world, right?

I didn't buy the chips that day. All of a sudden, reality wasn't so palatable.
