  My husband recently told me about a piece of fiction he wrote for an English
  task in high school, some twenty odd years ago. The minute he told me what
  he'd written and then relayed the comment he'd received from the teacher to
  justify a low grade, I knew his teacher was flat out wrong....

```

```

```
I'm not saying this out of loyalty, or some polite deference to the sentiment that 'everyone's viewpoint is unique and special'. The teacher was simply a slave to the system, elitist, and ... DEAD WRONG.  I say this not as a wife, nor a parent myself, and not even as a qualified teacher - which I am - but as someone devoted to the art of creativity and an avid consumer of AUTHENTICITY. I'm saying it as a movie-goer, an idealist, a realist and ... like most of you readers ... someone endeared to a good and faithful piece of story-telling. 
```

```

```

```
In the fictional piece my husband wrote, he was narrating from the point of view of a criminal - someone who had robbed a bank and was hell bent on making an escape. 
```

```

```

```
His nineteen eighties, bank-robbing character - in the head of the moment - yelled this ... "Shit, the pigs are coming!"
```

```

```

```
Dismissing the potential lack of originality in the plot line, I can argue one point categorically and most emphatically. And I know you WILL agree with me on this.
```

```

```

```
It is incredibly unlikely that the blue-collar, junkie-esque, bearing-the-scars-of-life villain in my husband's devised narrative would, in the heat of a heist gone wrong, have said to his partner-in-crime .... "Oh no, I think the police officers may now be on to us". 
```

```

```

```
THAT was the 'teacher version' of what was deemed more appropriate for grading purposes. 
```

```

```

```
Now I'm the first to admit that, for my husband, who'd ditch an 'academic' subject for sport anytime the opportunity arose, the grammar and punctuation in his piece may not have been strictly on point. But it was for that turn of phrase alone - "Shit, the pigs are coming!" - that the teacher cited the C+ grade as the upper level that could be achieved. 
```

```

```

```
Way to beat a kid into submission. 
```

```

```

```
Even if you don't share my enthusiasm for originality in writing, surely it's easy to acknowledge that a somewhat disengaged student rising to the occasion to pen a piece of fiction that feels interesting and authentic is something to be celebrated, any day of the week. 
```

```

```

```
Sure, you could argue that any student work should merely fit into the camber of the curriculum to have merit.
```

```

```

```
Though, I can't help but tell you how many times, both as a practising teacher and a parent, I have seen the truth in Albert Einstein's statement:
```

```

```

```
"Everyone is a genius. But if you judge a fish by its ability to climb a tree, it will live its whole life believing that it is stupid."
```

```

```

```
If you haven't picked up a Richard Branson book or read any of Scott Pape's works, including his current mailouts and blog posts, or viewed The Game Changers (produced by no less than James Cameron, Arnold Schwarzenegger and Jackie Chan) then you might simply want to put your head back in the sand. It could be safer for you that way.
```

```

```

```
But, if you care how the rules of the world - as Steve Jobs postured - might have been shaped by someone NO SMARTER THAN YOU, then read on.
```

```

```

```
And read widely, question everything and - most importantly - don't settle until the truth sits well with you.
```

```

```

```
Happy reading!
```
