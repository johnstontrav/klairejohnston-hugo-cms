Often forgotten, these 6 things are worthwhile incorporating into your regular cleaning sanitising regime (because health is important and gunk removal is never a bad thing).

**1. Your phone**

Your hands are all over it from first thing in the morning until last thing at night, right? Plus, your phone travels with you everywhere, including shops and outings, where have your mits on other high touch surfaces. 

Yet most of us drop our trusty little handsets back into our bags or onto our home tables and countertops right after use. 

Regular cleaning will see this become less of a moving germ factory.

Check your phone manufacturers guidelines and used an approved cleaning agent to suit your device and its cover and screen protector (a regular antibacterial wipe may not cut it).

**2. Your computer**

Apart from a general clean being good to remove fingerprints on your screen, plus dirt and dust, thinking about finger and keyboard interaction makes you realise how quickly germs might be transferred from one to the other. 

Try a daily wipe down with manufacturer specific cleaning guidelines in mind.

**3. Your steering wheel**

Every time you've been out in the world and then jump back in your car, many of us are developing a routine of sanitising our hands. I carry a pump sanitiser in the car door, but in case I touch the wheel - or the gear stick or park break or even interior buttons and handles - before I've used that (or if I've forgotten to do it on just one occasion), I'm increasing the chance of keeping nasties in circulation.

Abolishing the sweat and grime is the least your hard working car interior deserves.

**4. The bottom of your bag**

I know when I go to a public bathroom, I'm paranoid about not setting my handbag or backpack on the floor - ick! But in many other ways our bags can come into contact with dirty or germ-ridden surfaces - supermarket trolleys, shop countertops or tables and floors in cafes. 

We probably can't avoid all of these things all of the time, so try cleaning the bottom AND the handles of your bag (fabric permitting) at regular intervals, as well as NOT placing it on your own tabletops or countertops at home. 

For ease, I like to give my bag its own designated 'home' in my cupboard, where I can unpack and repack it without worrying about the widespread transferral of whatever its surfaces have picked up. 

**5. The TV remote**

When we sit down to flick on the tube we're not necessarily in a 'santising' mindset and instead are more likely to be munching on snacks, multitasking on other high-touch devices, or generally scratching parts of ourselves that haven't seen much attention during an otherwise busy day. 

It's a prime place for exposure to nasties as well as a general build up of gunk. 

Today's the day to begin light but regular wiping down of your remote.

**6. Your wallet**

Whether we're talking leather or polyester, Louis V or Target, your wallet has the potential to pick up bacteria and viruses through surface to surface contact or simply via your handling.

If you've been leaving this high touch item off your regular cleaning routine, consider how many times in a week you pull it out to make a cash or card purchase, stuff receipts into it, draw out a business card or store loyalty card or even transfer it from bag to bag.

Plus .. if you have kids who like ferreting for small change, consider they might be handling your wallet regularly too. 

I'd suggest a one-off clean out of all the old receipt-debris will do your Konmari-oriented genes a solid. Plus you'll gain extra peace of mind wiping down the interior, exterior and all regular contents, like bank debit cards.

As with any surface, reading the manufacturer's cleaning guidelines is paramount. 



If you don't currently include these six items on your cleaning regime, it's well worth considering. You may find many more you can add to your list. 

Stay safe.
