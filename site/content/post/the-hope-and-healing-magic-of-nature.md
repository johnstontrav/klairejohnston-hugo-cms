  We all feel it - that intuition that there is healing in nature.

  The truth of it is nature is all we can fall back on.

We wonder about resilience.  It's mentioned a lot these days. In the news. Between friends. In the back of our minds.

We can appear stoic in nature but how, when we're faced with literal beds that are burning, can we factor ourselves on the continuum of resilience if we have no real connection with nature?

I love [this article](https://www.domain.com.au/news/out-of-the-ashes-renewal-returning-home-after-bushfire-tore-through-it-924088/) - the image of 'rising from the ashes'. And I can't help but think on how this plays out closer to suburban streets and in towns on the fringes of the disaster that's just been witnessed. 

So, I went to my community garden and had the most delightful and enlightening experience there, solitary, in that secret garden. 

And despite being alone, all I could feel was ... connected. To the environment, to the purpose of the space to begin with and to something - beyond.

When you are in the midst of nature, and truly recognising he significance of it, there is a mutual understanding. A nod to all that is 'beyond'.

I love the intangible I discovered there and, not least because of the invitation to find humour in every corner, vow to go back ...
