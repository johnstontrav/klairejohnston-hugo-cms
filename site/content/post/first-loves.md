  Why is it that as we grow older we seem to stray from the things that
  delighted us most in childhood? And more importantly, how do we make that long
  trek back to the things that energises us, that really feed our soul ...

Adulting is tough. The 'basics' are expensive and attaining (then maintaining) a happy and healthy lifestyle takes a bit of work. And the challenges of life are certainly relentless. \

If we're fortunate, we manage to factor in to our busy worlds some of the things we enjoy - reading on rainy days, dinner out, a long bike ride, social club tennis, cooking classes, gaming, or a long and unapologetic sleep-in. 

Bets are on that in your youngest years, these weren't the things that made you buzz, that got you lost for hours, that gave way to pure enjoyment.

Our first loves were much more simple than that - collecting and polishing stones, adding features to a makeshift cubby, dressing up and being someone or something else entirely.  Think back to that 'play' you returned to whenever you had the opportunity.

## Where did you lose it?

Where did you lose it? And really, WHY did you?

Last week I made a huge leap forward simply by jumping decades in to the past.  

I decided to play shop.

I'm not unique in having spent some of my youth retailing old nick knacks to my parents or trying to sell sketchy produce to passers by on my front lawn (50c seemed good value for lemon juice added to store bought lemonade). I organised our play room into a lively retail space, made signs and kept that cash register ringing. 

## Sensible jobs

In Year Twelve, I applied to do Visual Merchandising at university and was accepted into a sought-after creative arts course but, on the advice of many 'wiser' than me, accepted a double degree that seemed to lean to a more esteemed corporate future. 

Unsurprisingly, that didn't stick. 

Now, after treading through years of 'sensible' jobs and spending leisure time on popular grown-uppy activities (which admittedly do bring me some sense of satisfaction), I went back to honour that girl in the play room.

Not far from home, full of positive intent and fabulous finds, is a family-run Op Shop.  The efforts of the owners notwithstanding, this shop is yearning for a bit of retail savvy; some bold display choices, clever merchandising and a bit of tough love. 

I felt a spark. So, I volunteered. \

After offering to spend an hour just to get a feel for whether THIS was where I wanted to 'give up' my time, I dragged myself out of there five hours later with a realisation that what I gave in time and expertise was paying back to me a hundred-fold in pure enjoyment.

I felt the buzz I had in my first retail jobs, at The Body Shop and IKEA, surrounded by ground-breaking philosophy, fabulous products and a healthy dose of philanthropy.  And while working in retail can be one of the tougher ways to make a living (and have a life) there is still something joyous for me about playing shop. 

Think back to those moments in your play room, sandpit, attic, tree house, back yard ... the ones that felt both joyous and comfortable, effortless yet valuable.

If you can do one thing for yourself in this hectic world, try to pay that place a visit every once in a while. 

Your soul will thank you.
