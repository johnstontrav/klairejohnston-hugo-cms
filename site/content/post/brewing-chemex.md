  Words are powerful.  And yet, we carry around these little weapons without
  truly understanding the way they can be wielded.

Some people have athletic ability. Others are good with their hands. Some may be natural leaders, have a voice like an angel, or love how maths makes them tick.

My gift has always been words. 

Words _are_ powerful. I've seen evidence of this in the stirring speeches of world leaders, the impassioned revelations of entrepreneurs, in clever TED Talks and through the artful lyrics of great songwriters.

The best comedians can move us to laughter, then to tears, then into a gut-wrenching, breathless and welcome combination of both. Sometimes with just one word.

Think about it. 'Yes' can mean so many things. Can change everything. 

And in the next beat, so can 'No'. 

## The words that changed everything

I've MC'd weddings, addressed government forums, conducted workshops and delivered guest speaker presentations. 

Yet it was a collection of only about a dozen lines that finally brought home the responsibility I carry to write hard and share big.  

Only last month, at the funeral of my grandmother, I wrote words from the heart and spoke them at the intimate ceremony.  When family members thanked me for their illumination of her great life and how these helped lift some of the sorrow, I felt a glow, knowing Grandma would also approve. 

The evening before, I helped my uncle frame up his eulogy, which was peppered with great ideas, though - according to him - just didn't yet thread together with the message he was trying to impart.

It was important, I knew. I thought it was about tribute. About legacy. Though what I saw in his face at the service, and the relief once the words were delivered and resonated around the room, made me realise I was wrong. It was actually about healing. 

Having crafted his words into the shape of the love he wanted to reflect, I gifted him something.

My words shifted his world. Those few lines held so much power. 

## I have never been asked to read anything twice ...

"It is the hardest thing - a long goodbye. And yet, what a life to celebrate. Grandma is weaved into our DNA, our consciousness, our memories, our subconsciouses. She still threads this family together ..."

These were the few words to my mother she borrowed for her speech on the day.  These were part of her healing, too.

I the emotional exhaustion of the aftermath fo the funeral, I busied myself with decluttering some corners of my home. In what seemed like an affirmation, I unearthed the eulogy I delivered for my father-in-law and for the first time in so long recall how many had come to me and thanked me for the way those words touched them.

Going through the papers I also found the words I had written for a friend, to hold on her behalf, should her cancer journey not turn out as desired.  

In the same box was a copy of anthology in which one of one of my poems is published. Notes from the judges of writing competitions I'd fared well in. A photograph of an early poem of mine hanging in a school administration building. 

The most recent stack of papers was a bunch of feedback forms from my latest creative writing workshop held just months ago. The responses of those attendees were not about the lyrical verses I had written, but how the words I spoke to them that day - the comments, critiques, suggestions - held enough gravity for them to feel energised about their writing again and to believe in the gift of their own words. 

One attendee introduced his reasons for attending the Creative Kickstart as simply to write for himself, as "everything that needs to be written has already been written".  To his great surprise, his beautifully crafted poem, written in that session, had captivated us all.  

He emailed me the next day ...

"I have never been asked to read anything twice. So thank you for that compliment. 

"I have never believed that what I wrote had any meaning except for me .... that anything I write could bring enjoyment to others".

## The surprise take

It's ironic really that it's taken the words of others - pointed, timely and surprising - to bring home to me the importance of sharing what I write. \

It would be polite to say I've felt compelled by a few wonderful and worldly people to share more of my work.  It would be more truthful to say that they're making a mission of ensuring I understand my responsibility of using this 'word thing' of mine to make a difference. They certainly won't take 'No' for an answer. 

So, I'm writing marketing copy for non-for-profits, poems for people to give to their lovers, and books to share with the world. 

I very much hope that, somewhere in all my words, there's something of a gift for you.
