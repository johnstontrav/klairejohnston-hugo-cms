  You guys remember what a landline is, right? And how almost no one ... not
  even you ... actually has that number. 


  Well. One minute from now, that landline's gonna ring.

This is what a bushfire evacuation plan looks like.  

![](/img/signal-attachment-2020-01-11-171117.jpeg)



Template issued from a home printer running out of ink. Made while your partner is on a business trip overseas because you realise that, despite the last three idillic summers, you now really, actually, ACTUALLY live in a full-on THAT SHIT'S QUITE REAL bushfire zone. You now hear it daily.

Your unpreparedness is the stuff that makes headlines out of ignorant people and you're not going to be one of those.

So, you print the template ... and skip the 'preparing for the bushfire season' section because you realise you aren't the one in the relationship with expertise on the whipper snipper and the snake hazard of thistles and weeds beside the garage has to belong on the ever-growing To Do List you are scrawling alongside the bushfire plan. 

It goes on the fridge next to the Christmas menu shopping list. 

You talk about it for half a minute on the long distance FaceTime call, but the kids are wanting to show off their latest scooter tricks, so. Priorities. 

Your trigger to leave is: SEVERE.

Why exactly? There are two danger ratings above that. 

Don't get - as usual - all over-thinky with this. Well...

Because it says: "Well-prepared homes that are actively defended can provide safety." 

Your uninsulated, kit-home style bungalow didn't come with a fire rating. And you don't know how to use the f^$%#ing whipper snipper. 

And HOW exactly should you block a drainpipe to fill your gutters, without creating a future plumbing emergency? 

You begin to hear useful statistics ... like your town is one of the five most likely to be impacted by surrounding bushfires IN THE WORLD. Don't Google it - it's not on the brochure. 

Much later you also learn that your town of under 3000 people evacuated 35,000 tourists in one day and you get that little glow of pride. You are told you're also one of the top tourist towns in the state this time of year. 

THE LANDLINE RINGS.

And you move. You move with absolute purpose while simultaneously doubting your every action. 

You read the list you are following OUT LOUD to yourself and make yourself say 'check' each time you've actually adhered to the plan.

You pack the dog bed, dog lead, dog bowl and dog food and for later review note that on your list you've actually omitted listing the DOG.  You remember the dog. 

You drive on a highway you've driven dozens of times, toward a place you've only ever approached from a different road. 

You stop at a service centre that has a long queue for McDonald's throbbing with impatience. 

As you check for latest alerts, you remember two things you forgot to pack, because you forgot they should even be on the list. 

Then you look at your Nissan Micra which, at capacity, has failed to attain the speed limit on the highway and think of items you left behind knowingly, which were built for the bushfire plan you made when you thought you had two cars to pack, with three other people to help, and a trailer in tow. 

Your dog looks forlorn. 

When you hit the bleeding lights of the CBD and realise you still have ninety minutes of unfamiliar roads to navigate at two hours past your usual bedtime you give a secret little thanks for the people who are about to receive you, for the worried voice at the end of the phone that is talking you through the ring road and for the fact you can ultimately wake up and worry about all these things anew in the morning.
