  Forget toilet paper. Two other tiny white squares have revolutionised my
  family's #selfisolation and homeschooling journey.  


  And they don't look to be falling out of favour with the kids any time soon.

As I type, my sons are sitting on our back deck playing HANGMAN with Nan on FaceTime.  Yes, we've gone 'old school' games quite quickly in this household. 

Instead of paper, my sons each have a whiteboard propped up in front of the screen. One manages revealing the word, while the other records the 'rejected' letters and draws the hangman. 

I'm loving the 20 minutes of sanity my new purchases have facilitated, though I admit I didn't buy them strictly with games in mind.

Amidst the chaos of an early 'school holiday' in Victoria, I decided to keep the wheels of education churning as long as I could. Don't mistake me - the structure of lessons in this Easter-eve phase was 90% for my sanity and only 10% about the kids' learning.

I'm a qualified teacher and, like most of us, a parent striving for that ever-elusive certificate in 'parental expertise' (for anyone who has been bestowed that type of qualification by someone other than themselves, hats off to you my friend).

One thing I know both parenting and education share is the necessity for routine. And also - I believe - flexibility. 

This is where my trusty $7 friend comes in.

With isolation overshadowing us in all its forms and the ability to access resources being a key topic of national conversation, I decided to purchase two cheap (not so nasty) whiteboards from my local supermarket, with the idea that they'd stem the depletion of A4 paper reams in our household and, frankly, feel a little bit more fun. 

The whiteboards came with bonus 3M tape to stick them to the wall (straight in the bin), two magnets (straight on to the fridge) and a marker with eraser built in ("shut up and take my money").

The first thing we did with the white squares was play Hangman. 

Then Celebrity Head. 

Then I went super old, old school and invoked 'Mr Squiggle'. It's a shame "upside down, Miss Jane" means nothing to several generations, particularly when it's an apt descriptor for the world at large right now. 

Then the quasi-home schooling began. 

And this is precisely where my $7 investment comes into its own. 

You see, I've conducted larger scale, hands-on experiments with mini-whiteboarding before. 

You heard me right. I'm nerding out.

As a teacher mentor and part of a Visible Learning Advisory Committee in a NSW Anglican School, I worked across a range of year levels, with hundreds of students of all ages and abilities, in dozens of subjects, in an effort to gather anecdotal evidence on the efficacy of visual learning frameworks in a classroom environment.

Wha- ? ZZZZzzzzzzz......

In plain English - I looked a how we can see what kids are really THINKING while learning, so we can help them better.

Now, I did a 48 slide TED Talk kinda thing for staff that got into all the nitty gritty of my findings. Let's face it though. 

You are simply looking to hear the benefits a #ofchildren x $whiteboard investment might offer you in this time of #covidcrisis.

Well, here's my answer to that. 

Here's what a whiteboard might do, that paper (blank/worksheets/notebooks) simply doesn't:-

* **It offers impermanence.** Kids are critiqued daily for their handwriting, evaluated on their written answers, expected to show a result on paper for any number of tasks. What if they can put something down that can easily be wiped away? Something that isn't there later to be pinned on a fridge or kept as a running record of achievement. So what if they spell skeletan with that 'a' or start doodling in the middle of a maths sum? It matters not when they are a mere wipe of a cloth from something new.
* **It gives kids freedom.** See above, and add creating any type of 2-D imagining to the list. Monsters farting out the answers to equations are fun, for example. And regular maths worksheets don't allow much room for those.
* **It encourages a new tactile experience.** It's why kids like running slime through their hands, using play-doh or banging one object against another over and over and over again. It FEELS different, and that sensory input sparks something great in the brain.
* **It makes kids feel like a BOSS**. Who uses whiteboards all day long? That most revered and influential figure (up there with nurse, firefighter and sports coach) ... their teacher. Suddenly kids get to set agendas for activities, write 'to do' lists and explain things to YOU on their mega-amazing, this-is-the-centre-of-my-learning-universe type board. That's real power, baby.
* **It lets you be 'good cop'**, when parenting in an ever-tightening physical arena might feel more heavily populated with 'bad cop' moments. I give my boys a few minutes at the start of our Japanese lessons to write down multi-lingual insults so we can all have a bit of light relief. It's not until the board is full and it's wiped away that the more P.C. learning starts.  
* **It's full of silent revelations.** With that one little magical marker and board you can truly work one-on-one, even while there are four of you gathered around the same table. Much to everyone's relief, not every thought needs to be shared.

Above all, what I discovered while teaching in classrooms where every student was given a whiteboard for the lesson is that, no matter the age, with a whiteboard in hand, creativity ensued.

I also found it the BEST supplement to other activities. Without interfering with the main goal, a mini-whiteboard facilitates communication that might other be lost.

It can be a canvas for brainstorming and a tablet for the 'working out' part of a scenario. It can hold the smiley face or frown by which a young one is expressing their feelings about their mood or an activity, without impacting on their application to the activity itself. 

**How to utilise when home schooling:-**

![](/img/screen-shot-2020-03-27-at-7.11.18-pm.png)

* Goal setting for the lesson/study period
* Encourage mind mapping and brainstorming
* Plan and note key ideas
* Show working (maths, chemistry, etc.)
* To "scaffold" (provide hints, illustrate with examples, etc)
* Jot down ideas or questions to 'park' and address later in the lesson/day so as not to interrupt the flow of what is going on.
* Jigsawing - multiple whiteboards can be combined towards one end project ("What are the main ideas we should include in our presentation?")
* Practising handwriting form (e.g. Japanese Hiragana or Kanji)
* Writing answers to verbal questions
* Using whenever a verbal answer is difficult ("How would you divide this cake between twelve people?")
* When answers might be rubbed out and revised along the way - "What does Australia look like? Can you mark the states and territories?"
* Releasing anxiety ... let kids doodle whatever they like, without comment. Home schooling can be tough for them too!

So, next time you venture on an expedition for milk, pasta or the ever-elusive bog roll, consider popping a white-board or two into your trolley (and maybe an extra pack of markers for good measure).

Whether holidaying or home-schooling, you might just be glad you did.



_**FUN Activity Ideas**_ 

Sharing one whiteboard:-

* Hangman
* Mr Squiggle (complete my drawing)
* Write a silly poem, taking turns to write a line at a time
* Noughts and crosses - for a challenge, try a 4 x 4 grid with only three-in-a-row needed
* Guess my number between 1 and 20 (the board stops any cheating ;)
* Clue - hide an object in the house and write clues to help find it. Swap and repeat.

With a whiteboard each:-

* 'Psychic' shapes / numbers / letters / anything. E.g. Let's both write a name beginning with 'B' and reveal our answers to see if we can get a match.
* 'Celebrity head' - set each other an identity and ask yes or no questions to be the first to discover yours
* Play any game and keep a tally of each other's scores
* 'Memory' board. Write words, numbers or shapes on a board, reveal it for a short time and have the other person try to recreate it exactly.
* Draw a caricature of each other.
* Pick a series of letters and each make as many 2+ letter words as you can. What is the biggest combined total list you can make?
* Silent challenge. How long can you each go without speaking? (Guardians ... offer a prize for the winner?!)

Use your imagination to create more...

Happy quarantine!
