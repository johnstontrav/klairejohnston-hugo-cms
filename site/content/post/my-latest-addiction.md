  It's only been a week, but I know in this short time I'm developing a habit
  that is going to be mighty hard to break ...

It started with a simple Google search.

See, I have things I've been desperate to give away. Ordinarily I'd find new homes for books, toys and kids clothes by taking them to my local op shop. But, like many businesses  during this covid pandemic, it's remained closed. Both for shopping - \*sigh\* - and donations.  

So, with a house full of boxes due to renovations underway and a growing pile of special pieces that could be loved by someone else I know I just had to get these things shifted and asked Mr Google to show me where. 

That's how I found GIVIT.

Rather than being a single charity, it is a platform that aggregates requests from various charities all over Australia for donated items, or vouchers to cover the cost of necessities for those doing it particularly tough. 

I plugged the types of items I had to give away into a search and started my journey down that rabbit hole. 

Now .. I'm a sucker for a story and reading the short descriptions of people's hardship brought me to tears many times. I became overwhelmed for a little while at just how great the need was out there for the smallest things I could take for granted.   

Like someone wanting a blanket for winter, or a bath towel, or a notebook and pencils for a child. 

After days of spinning in circles and coming back to my computer to stare at the dozens of open tabs I had for places needing donated items, I got my act together and started ACTUALLY giving.

I offered books to a toy room for the DIY Dads program at the Hobart City Mission, Boys Size 6 clothes to a grandmother in poverty raising her grandson with special needs, and the rest of the odd sized clothing to a Queensland organisation that last year clothed over 700 men, women and children during winter. 

Then I waited. 

Within hours my Givit offering had been gratefully received and all that was left for me to do was post them to the organisations that had validated and listed the requests. 

Squeeee!  How good that felt!

Now, I'm a minimalist living in a shoe box house and knowing that we were operating only on essentials ourselves now, there was nothing else to prise from the cupboards to give away.

Instead, my sons and I had afternoon tea in front of my computer and talked about what I'd discovered, what I'd done. Then I offered this as a way of spending the coins they'd been collecting all year in their 'giving' jars.

Our first stop was a family whose boys were sleeping in a bare bedroom. After our holiday expedition to spend pocket money at K Mart (just about as exciting to them as a trip to Dreamworld!) they decided they could offer those boys a similar experience. So we bought a shopping voucher for them to go and choose their own posters, bedside lamps, toys and whatever to transform their room into somewhere they'd feel more comfortable to sleep.

We're still searching for other places to give. 

And now that I'm picturing the faces of people who just received something they desperately needed, I thought about what it might feel like to give a little bit more.

Until I have the means to wipe out all 1047* donation requests in a single blow (hello winning lottery ticket) I've added something crafty to my giving ... literally.

_\*Changing by the minute ..._

My order of a felt pocket heart kit from 1000 Hearts is now on its way and with it I plan to join the movement of all the other Heartists out there (yes, it's a thing!) and stitch little hearts to give away to brighten someone's day.

I'm grateful for finding GIVIT because it's actually tough to make the act of giving feel tangible for kids, when they can't always participate on a level that adults can (like working in a soup kitchen, or handing out blankets on the streets). Kids know they want to give, and know they have the means (their coin jars), but it is the connection to an individual with a tangible in a particular adverse circumstance that can be hard to illuminate. 

For me GIVIT has gone some way to filling that gap. 

Finally, if you have read this far, and have had the benefit of eating a solid meal today, wearing clean clothes or sleeping without fear in your own home, consider pooling your change or getting your Marie Kondo on and doing a quick GIVIT search.

You'll be nothing but glad that you did.
