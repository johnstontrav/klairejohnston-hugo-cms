To be honest, the last twenty-four hours were something I'd never put on a bucket list, never imagine I'd go through and, in the same breath, never wish away.

From the Latchford Barracks car park, two army personnel - almost certainly with higher priorities - personally escorted me in my misdirected wanderings to the reception area for evacuees. You could tell small talk wasn't in their training, or even in their comfort zone, though they worked hard to make me feel like I wasn't in the middle of a crisis. 

With a 40kg Border Collie in tow, I was made to feel like the most welcome person in town.

There was a briefing on facilities, an escort to my room and bags carried for me, making everything feel that much less painful.

At dinner in the Mess, many of us spotted our own community members and it began to feel a little more familiar. Then ...

A legitimate bushfire emergency broke out a few kilometres away. The power to the barracks simultaneously went out.

And so it eventuated that hundreds of us spent ninety minutes in the Mess, in the dark, sharing stories that would be the backbone of a night no one expected. 

I chatted to another parent from my son's school and met some travellers from Stuttgart who had underestimated our nation's disaster situation.

All the while no one explicitly mentioned what was on all of our minds. 

No one panicked, though the concern for our houses and towns was palpable. 

This time of crisis saw everyone I came into contact with at their absolute best, despite their individual concerns. 

And threading this unexpected tapestry together were the army personnel.

Yes, they are absolutely to be admired for their ability to do their jobs well. Beyond this they are to be valued for skills displayed well beyond their position descriptions ... an outstanding effort to sympathise, empathise, embrace humour in the face of adversity, spread calm, open arms, demonstrate flexibility and  - most importantly - lift spirits.  

It's not easy in a cricis to sleep alongside several hundred strangers.  Our defence forces really helped soften the blow.
