I've just pulled in to town. It's exactly the same, apart from the extra 35,000 people who should be staying here. There is a blue sky, a calm breeze, restaurants are open .. and it's a week since the tourists left town.



The locals are putting on 'normal'. And to be honest, we're pretty good at it. Shops staffed with familiar faces, good meals and coffee to be had once you're willing to adapt to limited menus and shortened hours. But there's the horrible reconciliation to be dealt with. 



Did you stay or did you go? Where did you go? And what have we missed?



To be honest, the last twenty-four hours were something I'd never put on a bucket list, never imagine I'd go through and, in the same breath, never wish away.



From the Latchford Barracks car park, two army personnel - almost certainly with better things to do - personally escorted me in my misdirected wanderings to the reception area for evacuees. You could tell small talk wasn't in their training, or even in their comfort zone, though they worked hard to make me feel like I wasn't in the middle of a crisis. 



With a 40kg Border Collie in tow, I was made to feel like the most welcome person in town.



There were briefings on facilities, a personal escort to our rooms and bags carried for us just to make everything feel that much less painful.



At dinner in the Mess, many of us congregated with community members and it began to feel a little more familiar:- as though some of our small town had been picked up and transported to this unfamiliar place. Then ...



The next few hours were chaos.



The short version is that our army personnel are to be absolutely admired for their ability to do their jobs. And they are to be valued for the skills displayed well beyond their position descriptions ... an outstanding effort to sympathise, empathise, embrace humour in the face of adversity, spread calm, open arms, demonstrate flexibility and lift spirits.  



A legitimate bushfire emergency broke out a few kilometres away. The power to the barracks simultaneously went out.



And so it eventuated that hundreds of us spent ninety minutes in the Mess, in the dark, sharing stories that would be the backbone of a night no one expected. 



I chatted to a single Dad from my son's school and met some travellers from Stuttgart who had underestimated our disaster situation.



All the while no one explicitly mentioned what was on all of our minds. 



No one panicked, though the concern for our houses and towns was palpable. 



This time of crisis saw everyone I came into contact with at their absolute best, despite their individual concerns. 



I must say thought, the key to maintaining sanity was simply to be accepting.
