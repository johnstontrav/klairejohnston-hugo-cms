  Being displaced from home is a stressful experience and the one of the first
  things in jeopardy can easily be one's sanity. 


  Despite a grassfire neighbouring our evacuation centre at the barracks, I was
  probably under equal threat from alcoholic old Robbo in my quarters tripping
  me over while staggering around our common areas.

Robbo's miniature yappy little Maisie kept trying to attack my Aussie, who was frightened despite his 39 kg weight advantage. 

Robbo's repeated suggestions that the two dogs would be friendlier once they'd met were great ... he just failed to recall the fact they had already met (only around 8 times) and that this didn't allay the situation. 

Luckily Beverley, with her respiratory problems and low mobility, was a ready conversationalist, so I could extract myself from Robbo's loop of dialogue with greater ease. 

Support workers interjected themselves during breakfast and were most happy to chat. _Did you know we are specially making barista coffees from around ten just through those doors?_

Board games were purchased for kids and everyone was invited to use the indoor pool. A blind eye was turned to dogs swimming in the lake. 

Upon check out, a Private manning the information centre joked with me about not stealing anything from the mini-bar.

Then I got in the car, free from threat of fires (for now) and on the firm road home, sobbing more than I care to admit.

Back in town I had dinner out, eager to spend at a business who is used to turning people away. I noted that the place that accommodated hundreds in one sitting had about fourteen of us helping justify the opening of the establishment at all.

We are trying, while already knowing our efforts are incredibly insufficient. 

I felt privileged to have a few minutes to chat with my waitress, who lives in our neighbouring village. She actually had a moment to sit at my table, to learn my name and to shake my hand. We both almost reduced each other to tears.

I hope I see her again in passing, if only to nod and pretend things are back to normal. To reaffirm I remember she was one of nineteen casual employees for this summer in this one business, whose turnover had instantaneously been reduced by 99%.

I hope to see her again because she, like me, is part of the fabric here. 

Our town will adapt. People will adapt.

But, for those aspiring to get there, it will be a long and hard road to 'normal'.
