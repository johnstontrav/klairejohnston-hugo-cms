  I was probably under equal threat from alcoholic old Robbo* in my quarters
  tripping me over while staggering around our common areas as I was from fire.

Robbo's miniature yappy little Maisie* kept trying to attack my Aussie, who was frightened despite his 39 kg weight advantage. Robbo's repeated suggestions that the two dogs would be friendlier once they'd met were great ... he just failed to recall the fact they had already met (only around 8 times) and that this didn't allay the situation. 

Luckily, Beverley*, with her emphysema and low mobility, was a ready conversationalist so I could extract myself from his presence wit greater ease. All fun and games during an evacuation!

Support workers interjected themselves during breakfast and were most happy to chat while we dispensed with normal etiquette ("Yes, please go ahead and eat. And did you know we are specially making barista coffees from around ten just through those doors?")

I didn't get the coffee, despite the invitation. Though I did see the kids playground. I did enjoy letting my Aussie off lead in the lake on base so he could drag ridiculously large branches out and feel his own sense of accomplishment. I did manage to fetch things for people less able, when I was going in that direction. I did manage to joke with the Privates and Corporals manning the information centre about not stealing anything from the mini-bar.

Then I got in the car, free from threat of fires (for now) and on the firm road home, sobbing more than I care to admit. 

Back in town I had dinner out, eager to spend at a business who is used to turning people away. I noted that the place that accommodated hundreds in one sitting had about fourteen of us making the rounds.

We are trying, while already knowing our efforts are incredibly insufficient. 

I felt privileged to have a few minutes to chat with my waitress Mathilde*, from our neighbouring village. She actually had a moment to sit at my table and to learn my name and shake my hand. We both almost reduced each other to tears.

I hope I see Mathilde again, if only to nod and pretend things are back to normal. To reaffirm I realise she was one of nineteen casual employees for a business summer that had it's turnover reduced by 99%.

I hope to see her again, not because I know her well. But because she, like me, is part of the fabric here. And we are well and truly in jeopardy of losing each other in the sea of what is to come. 

Our town will adapt. People will adapt.

But, for those aspiring to get there, it will be a long and hard road to 'normal'.
