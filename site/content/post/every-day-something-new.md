Every day, something new. 

That was it. I was tired of inventing resolutions I'd only pretend to keep. Disappointed by the prospect of not really knowing, as the clock ticked down to midnight on December 31, what I resolved to accomplish in the next full year.

Get fitter?

Read more?

Worry less?

Travel to somewhere-or-other ... ?

\*sigh\* I guess. 

There is nothing WRONG with those goals. It's just that I'd navigated them before. And I wasn't in love with the idea of any of them. They felt akin to the 'organised fun' of a team building exercise or taking  vitamins because you know they'll be good for you. 

I wanted something I'd be excited by, yet was still potentially within reach. 

So, I simplified. What's easier than a goal that can be accomplished (or not!) in a 24 hour deadline? An undertaking that has no other parameters than that it has to be new.

Have you ever played 'Secret Hitler', learned 'fire' in sign language or chalk-bombed your town's sidewalks with positive messages?

Neither had I, until January this year.

Have you watched Pulp's 'Common People' video clip all the way through? Discovered the world's least-spoken languages or its largest working cattle station? Or enjoyed a coconut milk cappuccino outdoors?

More importantly ... why should you?

Because - and here's the kicker - because trying something new can absolutely make all the difference in the world to your sense of wellbeing.

Now, I'm NOT saying you should do any of the things I've listed above, because, well, in and of themselves they're unlikely to revolutionise your world. See, it's not WHAT you do that's important, it's  the SEARCH for something new that is the point. 

This year I've done at least 91 things that I have NEVER done before. They don't yet make a special badge for that (maybe that's my 'new thing' for Day 92?).  So what's my prize? 

It's being able to wake up every morning with a fresh perspective on the world. And the ability to go to sleep at night knowing I have absolute control over the trajectory of my existence not being 'same, same' ever again.

I don't apologise for standing in the street on the 8th of March holding a packet of newly-purchased toilet paper over my head and yelling 'VICTORY!' It offered me the opportunity to strike up conversation with a passer by, who turned out to be a neighbour I was yet to meet.

Each of my new activities, while small in themselves, has had an exponential impact on the way I view the otherwise mundane, on the expectations I set for myself and on the permission I give myself to tread different paths to those that lead only to places I already know. 

'New' means stretching our thinking in a different direction, viewing the world from a different angle and working a little bit each and every day to make room for possibility.

'New' brings about creativity, compassion, laughter, light, intrigue, ingenuity and a great sense of fulfilment. 

New experiences are the very least of the gifts we can give to ourselves.
